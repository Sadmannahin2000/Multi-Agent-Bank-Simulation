# 🏦 Multi-Agent Bank Simulation

A Java simulation of a banking system that uses **multi-threaded agent operations** to process deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and audits concurrently.  
This project demonstrates concepts of **thread synchronization**, **concurrency**, and **file-based transaction logging**.

---

## 🧠 Overview
This simulation models a simplified banking environment with multiple agent classes acting simultaneously:
- **DepositorAgent** – deposits money into accounts  
- **WithdrawalAgent** – handles withdrawals while preventing overdrafts  
- **TransferAgent** – transfers funds between accounts  
- **AuditAgent** – reviews transactions and ensures data integrity  
- **TransactionLogger** – logs all activity for analysis  
- **Main.java** – initializes and coordinates the multi-threaded agents
